This is a script to allow you to run and throw strats at the same time on keyboard just like thos bitches can do on controller.

you run the script.. but first
remap movement keys to IJKL in place of WASD.
Don't forget he vehicle movement ones too.

Then, also remap strategem inputs to the arrow key cluster.

OK.  so then bind a mouse button or whatever to emit F11+F12.  This is your run+forward+strategem button


ONE compromise- when you are inputting arrow keys for a hellbomb or extraction or a terminal... you have to use the arrow keys.. I couldn't think of a good way to make E toggle the state of the inputs.  If you have a better idea LMN.
