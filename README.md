This is a script to allow you to run and throw strats at the same time on keyboard just like thos bitches can do on controller.

you run the script.. but first
remap movement keys to IJKL in place of WASD.
Don't forget he vehicle movement ones too.

Then, also remap strategem inputs to the arrow key cluster.

OK.  so then bind a mouse button or whatever to emit F11+F12.  This is your run+forward+strategem button
